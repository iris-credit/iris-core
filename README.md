# Iris

Iris is a non-custodial fixed-rate, fixed-term lending protocol for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
Rather than run its own rate market, it overlays fixed terms on variable-rate venues such as Morpho Blue and Aave V3, isolating each loan's collateral and debt in a single-use pod.
A solver signs an off-chain quote and a borrower accepts it, fixing the borrower's rate to maturity while the venue keeps charging a floating rate; the solver posts a bond that covers the spread between the two legs and, in return, earns that spread plus the collateral's venue yield, net of a protocol fee.
Loans that pass maturity and their overdue period, and bonds that can no longer cover the floating leg, become permissionlessly liquidatable, and positions can be refinanced across whitelisted venues.
Governance, expected to be a timelock, enables venues, bond lock modules (BLMs), and market parameters.

## Documentation
